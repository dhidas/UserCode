How To Run CCE Analysis (from command line)

Created: 2009-06-23 by Jennifer Sibille

*******************************************************************************

There are two possibilities to run data analysis through the command line:
      1. A single run at a time
      2. Many runs at the same time
Here the instructions for each case are listed.

All programs are run from the /sensorTest/tilmanOffline directory.



1. SINGLE RUN AT A TIME
   
   There are two programs that must be run to analyze a run.

   convert_to_tree and pulseHeightMain: 
   
   ./convert_to_tree -l -r <run#>
		     - creates the file run_00<run#>.root
		     - for trim different from 60, add -t <trim>

   ./pulseHeightMain <run#>
		     - creates the file spectra_00<run#>.root which
		     contains all relevant graphs and histograms such
		     as charge distributions and hitmaps



   charge_vs_bias:

   Once all of the runs for a chip have been analyzed in this fashion,
   a third program (charge_vs_bias) must be run in order to get the
   various plots vs. bias voltage for the whole chip. First you must
   put the information for the chip in the listOfSamples.tab file.

   The format for this is:
        "Dir. name" "fluence" "particle" "trim vcal" "temp" "structure"

        "Dir. name" = everything after "singleROC_"
        "fluence" = fluence in units 10^14 Neq/cm^2
        "particle" = oo for unirradiated
                     pi for pions
                     pr for protons
        "trim vcal" = value used for trim Vcal (set in GUI, see step 5
		      of "HowToCCE_newGui.txt)
        "temp" = average temperature during testing in Celsius
                 To find the temperature take the average resistance
                 in Ohms, input to the spreadsheet
		 "TemperatureInterpolation.sxc" on the Desktop to get the temp
		 in C. 
        "structure" = dot1 for chips ending in 6, 7, 11, 12
                      gap30 for chips ending in 5, 10
                      gap30-2 for chips ending in 8, 13

         Example: For chip 8613-13-08 in directory singleROC_8613-13-08_C,
         which is irradiated with protons at 2.8*10^15 Neq/cm^2, and tested
         with trim vcal = 45 at an average temperature of -9.62C:

         8613-13-08_C 28 pr 45 -9.62 gap30-2

   ./charge_vs_bias -n
	Creates the following plots:
            -"charge_vs_bias"
            -"charge_vs_phi"
            -"ileak_vs_bias"
            -"noise_vs_bias"
            -"noisyPix_vs_bias"
	in the following file formats (in tilmanOffline dir.):
            -eps
            -pdf
            -tif (only charge_vs_bias and charge_vs_phi)
	Creates "AllChipPlots.root" with the above-listed plots.
	Analyzes the scurves for noise information.




2. MANY RUNS AT THE SAME TIME

   To analyze many runs at the same time the charge_vs_bias program
   can be run with command line options to run the convert_to_tree and
   pulseHeightSpectrum programs "on the fly."  Read the directions for
   running charge_vs_bias above.  Instead of ./charge_vs_bias -n, use
   ./charge_vs_bias -c -s -n.
		    -c : runs convert_to_tree
		    -s : runs pulseHeightSpectrum
		    -n : runs noise

   This can take a long time!  It is recommended to set this to run
   over lunch or night, when it will not take up computer resources
   that you would be using.



3. NOISE ANALYSIS ONLY

   The analysis of the scurves for the noise information is generally
   done in the charge_vs_bias program, but can be run alone.

   ./noise <dirName>
	   - dirName is the name of the singleROC directory where the
	   scurves are stored, but without the "singleROC_"
	   Example:
		To run the noise analyzer on singleROC_8244-17-06_C,
		./noise 8244-17-06_C
